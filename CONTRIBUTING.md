# Contributor Guide

Thank you for your interest in improving this project.
This project is open-source under the [Apache 2.0 license] and
welcomes contributions in the form of bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.

Here is a list of important resources for contributors:

- [Source Code]
- [Documentation] (Updated link pending)
- [Issue Tracker]
- [Code of Conduct]

[apache 2.0 license]: https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0

[issue tracker]: https://github.com/TGSAI/mdio-cpp/issues

## How to report a bug

Report bugs on the [Issue Tracker].

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

- Which operating system and compiler are you using?
- Which version of this project are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a test case,
and/or steps to reproduce the issue.

## How to set up your development environment

### Requied tools
- CMake 3.24 or better
- A C++17 compiler
  - GCC 11 or better
  - Clang 14 or better
- ASM_NASM compiler
  - NASM version 2.15.05
- Python 3.9 or better

### Optional tools (Code quality control)
- clang-format version 18
- cpplint version 1.6.1

### Optional tools (Integration)
- Python module xarray version 2024.6.0 or better

### Alternative
Another alternative is to use a [Development Container] has been setup to provide
an environment with the required dependencies. This facilitates development on
different systems.

This should seamlessly enable development for users of [VS Code] on systems with docker installed.

### Known Issues:

- `cmake ..` may print "CMake Deprecation Warning at build/_deps/nlohmann_json_schema_validator-src/CMakeLists.txt:1".

## How to include MDIO

Fetch the library with development requirements:

```CMake
FetchContent_Declare(
  mdio
  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/TGSAI/mdio-cpp.git
  GIT_TAG main
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(mdio)
```

Link the library against your source:
(Note that the `mdio_INTERNAL_DEPS` variable is required for the linker)

```CMake
target_link_libraries(my_executible PRIVATE mdio ${mdio_INTERNAL_DEPS})
```

You can now include **MDIO** in your source code:

```C++
#include <mdio/mdio.h>
```

[development container]: https://containers.dev/
[vs code]: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers/

## How to test the project

```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
# NOTE: "CMake Deprecation Warning at build/_deps/nlohmann_json_schema_validator-src/CMakeLists.txt:1" can safely be ignored
$ cmake ..
```
Each **MDIO** target has the prefix "mdio" in its name, to build the tests run the following commands from the build directory:
```bash
$ make -j32 mdio_acceptance_test
```
The acceptance test will validate that the MDIO/C++ data can be read by Python's Xarray. To ensure that the test passes, make sure your Python environment has Xarray install, and run the acceptance test:
```bash
$ cd build/mdio/
$ ./mdio_acceptance_test
```
The dataset and variables have their own test suite too: 
```bash
$ make -j32 mdio_variable_test
$ make -j32 mdio_dataset_test
```
Each **MDIO** library will provide an associated cmake alias, e.g. mdio::mdio which can be use to link against **MDIO** in your project.

## How to submit changes

Open a [pull request] to submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- The unit test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
- The format and linting pass without errors or warnings.
  - Using `// NOLINT` or `// clang-format off` should be used sparingly and narrowly.
- Include unit tests. This project aims to maintain 100% code coverage.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, thoughâ€”we can always iterate on this. Drafts are encouraged.

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.
